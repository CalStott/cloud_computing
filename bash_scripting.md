# Bash Scripting notes

1. Create a file e.g. `nano basic_script.sh` - the file extension can either be __.sh__ for shell or __.bash__ for bash
2. Start the document with `#!/bin/bash` to tell the script which shell to use
   - _#! is known as a shebang_ 
3. List out the steps for the script in text (using # at the start)
4. Write the commands for each step of the script
5. Save the file
   - ctrl + x
   - Yes
   - Enter (if you want to overrite file instead of create a new file) 
6. Run the script using `source <script>` or `./<script>`

Recommended to write the script in VSCode and then copy across to bash
